# Applied Machine Learning - APAM reading group

Materials and schedule for APAM reading group based on course COMS4995 [(link)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s19/schedule/) from Andreas C. Muller. Additionally, we will cover some sections from Andrew Ng's course CS229 [(link)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s19/schedule/).
